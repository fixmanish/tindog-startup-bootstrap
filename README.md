## Introduction 🌟
Welcome to the Tindog Project! This project was developed as part of the web development bootcamp by Angela YU. Tindog is a website built using Bootstrap that serves as a landing page for a unique concept—finding partners for your furry friends online, just like the popular Tinder application does for humans!

Please note that Tindog is a conceptual website and not a real matchmaking platform for dogs. However, you can take inspiration from this concept to create your own real-world website. We're here to support you on your journey! 🚀

## Acknowledgements 🙏
